# Node Operators

Mina is secured by proof of stake consensus. Unlike other legacy protocols, any participant in a Mina network can validate transactions like a full node â€” making decentralization possible.

Node operators are people that run mina nodes. 

The Mina nodes fulfill different roles within the network, including:

1. [Block producers](/node-operators/block-producers) - this is analogous to being a Bitcoin "miner" or a "validator" in other proof-of-stake networks. By staking MINA, you can be selected to produce a block and win the block reward.

2. SNARK coordinators - distribute work to a series of [SNARK workers](/node-operators/snark-workers) in parallel. 

See [Staking & Snarking](/node-operators/staking-and-snarking).
