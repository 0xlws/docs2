# Connect to Devnet

:::note

A new version of Mina Docs is coming soon! This page will be rewritten.

:::

The Devnet network is designed for testing and experimentation. Devnet is a dedicated network for developers who are building on top of the Mina protocol. 

MINA on this network holds no real value. To request a prefunded account, reach out on [Mina Protocol Discord](https://discord.gg/minaprotocol).

If you are interested in running a node, connect
to [Mainnet network](connecting-to-the-network) instead.

## Update your software

Connecting to Devnet requires a specific build of the Mina client and a specific version of a peers list. 

Follow the steps for your operating system.

### Ubuntu 18.04 and Debian 9

Install the latest **Stable** [Mina Release 1.3.1.2](https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/releases/tag/1.3.1.2) or visit the [GitHub Releases Page](https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/releases) to install pre-release (Alpha/Beta) builds.

TO set up the new debian `stable` repository and install the latest version:

```sh
echo "deb [trusted=yes] http://packages.o1test.net $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mina.list
sudo apt-get install --yes apt-transport-https
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install --yes curl unzip mina-devnet=1.3.0-9b0369c
```

To check that daemon installed correctly:

```sh
mina version
```

The expected output is:

```text
Commit 9b0369c27bb85c8ab2f8725c6e977eb27b53b826 on branch master
```

## Start and connect a node to Devnet

To start a Mina node instance and connect to the Devnet network:

```
mina daemon --peer-list-url https://storage.googleapis.com/seed-lists/devnet_seeds.txt
```

### Docker

To run your daemon using Docker, create a directory on the host machine to mount as a volume:

```sh
cd ~
mkdir ~/.mina-config
```

To produce blocks or customize the configuration for the mina daemon, create the `~/.mina-env` file:

```sh
export MINA_PRIVKEY_PASS="My_V3ry_S3cure_Password"
LOG_LEVEL=Info
FILE_LOG_LEVEL=Debug
EXTRA_FLAGS=" --block-producer-key <BLOCK_PRODUCER_KEY_PATH>"
PEER_LIST_URL=https://storage.googleapis.com/seed-lists/devnet_seeds.txt
```

- Replace <BLOCK_PRODUCER_KEY_PATH> with the full path to your block producer private key. For example, `/home/ubuntu/keys/my-wallet`.

If you do not want to produce blocks, then provide only the `PEER_LIST_URL`.

Now, run the image with your `~/.mina-config` and `~/.mina-env` files mounted into the container:

```sh
docker run --name mina -d \
-p 8302:8302 \
--restart=always \
--mount "type=bind,source=$(pwd)/.mina-env,dst=/entrypoint.d/mina-env,readonly" \
--mount "type=bind,source=$(pwd)/.mina-config,dst=/root/.mina-config" \
minaprotocol/mina-daemon:1.3.1.2-25388a0-bullseye-devnet \
daemon \
```

To follow the logs:

```sh
docker logs -f mina
```

If the node crashes, save the log output to a file:

```sh
docker logs mina > mina-log.txt
```

To monitor connectivity to the network:

```sh
docker exec -it mina mina client status
```
