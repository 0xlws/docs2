# Testworld Mission 2.0 Protocol Performance Testing
The Testworld Mission 2.0: Protocol Performance Testing program is here. The goal of this program is to stress test the protocol and network with Mina community members to have a high level of confidence for Mina’s upcoming mainnet upgrade that will enable easier zkApps on Mina Mainnet.

The Program gathers experienced node operators to provide the network backbone for the Testworld 2.0 testnet. Participants will perform various node operation testing tasks for different grants. Participants can perform multiple node operation tasks.

## Launching the Nodes

Testworld Mission 2.0 nodes must run with the flags specified here in order to conduct the testing.  

1. [Block Producers](#block-producer)
2. [Load Testers](#load-tester)
3. [SNARK Workers](#snark-worker)
4. [SNARK Coordinators](#snark-coordinator)
5. [Archive Node](#archive-node) 

For more information about running nodes see the [node operators](https://docs.minaprotocol.com/node-operators) section of the Mina docs.

Use the latest Testworld Mission 2.0 release, releases can be found at [releases](https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/releases) and we will announce the correct version on this [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/484437221055922177/1093199272423473222) channel.

## Archive Node
The hardware requirements for Archive Nodes are located [here](./technical-requirements#archive-node)

The Archive node requires a non block producing node and PostgreSQL, for more information about running Archive Nodes see [Archive Node](https://docs.minaprotocol.com/node-operators/archive-node). 


Any updates to setup requirements will be included with the release notes and instructions provided closer to testnet launch. To run Protocol Performance Testing nodes the following flags are needed.

## Port configuration
Nodes need to have the following ports public (accessible with a node’s external ip):

- Libp2p port (8302 by default)
- Control GraphQL port (configured with --itn-GraphQL-port) use `3086`

## Generation of libp2p keypair

Use

```
mina libp2p generate-keypair -privkey-path <path-to-the-key-file>

```
to generate a libp2p keypair on your machine. 

## Node Restarts
All nodes to be set up such that they restart on crash
