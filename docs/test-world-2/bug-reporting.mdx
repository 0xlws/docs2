# Testworld Mission 2.0 Protocol Performance Testing
The Testworld Mission 2.0: Protocol Performance Testing program is here. The goal of this program is to stress test the protocol and network with Mina community members to have a high level of confidence for Minaâ€™s upcoming mainnet upgrade that will enable easier zkApps on Mina Mainnet.

The Program gathers experienced node operators to provide the network backbone for the Testworld 2.0 testnet. Participants will perform various node operation testing tasks for different grants. Participants can perform multiple node operation tasks.

## Reporting Bugs

All participants are  expected to raise any abnormal behavior during the protocol performance testing on Github.
