## General Questions




### Why did you develop a new protocol?

The reason for developing a new protocol instead of offering services to other blockchains is because adding SNARKs after the fact to a Layer 1 project is not trivial. Even basic operations need to be optimized for performance inside a SNARK, and existing implementations are not able to be retrofit as such. If we look at hashing functions for example, SHA256 (used by Bitcoin) or Keccak (used by Ethereum) are extremely expensive inside a SNARK circuit, but Poseidon (what Mina uses) is optimized for performance. This and many other technical considerations make it infeasible to easily add recursive SNARKs to existing Layer 1 blockchains, without entirely overhauling the base protocol.

#### How does Mina verify the current state of the chain without having historical data? How do you audit a transaction if you only keep a proof of the blockchain?

The average user does not need to know the entire transaction history. For
example, when you make a purchase using a dollar, you also don't need to know
where that dollar came from and how it was spent before arriving in your wallet.
Other blockchains depend on the transaction history to verify that the current
state is valid. Mina is using zk-SNARKs to prove that (see
[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWVGATxEB6M) where co-founder Izaak
Meckler explains Mina's recursive use of zk-SNARKs). This enables Mina to become
the world's lightest blockchain and to always be accessible for all.

For cases where a user wants to prove the inclusion of past transactions, Mina
has a feature called the receipt chain. Each account has its own receipt chain,
represented in the current state by a hash. When a user sends a transaction from
an account, that transaction modifies the receipt chain of the account, to be
the hash of the previous receipt chain, and the new transaction (a merkle list).
This allows users to prove a particular transaction was sent from their account.

For programs, Mina uses a different programming paradigm than other chains -
instead of being able to reference past history, you can only reference the
current state. This is akin to a filesystem that allows writing, deleting, and
overwriting data, rather than the “append only” filesystem seen in the usual
blockchain. This is intentional, so that Mina will always be lightweight, and
sustainable - once the proof is available to stand in for the history, storing
the history is more for archival or reference purposes, rather than security or
necessary use.

The programming paradigm in Mina will be designed to reflect this - right now
Mina has minimal data per account. Programs storing more data will have to pay
some amount for that data, likely when added with something like state rent.

Clients that do seek to have the full archival history can operate as archive
nodes, to store the full history as well. However, because unlike other
blockchains the full history isn’t necessary for any actions that can be
performed on chain, these are more for data analysis purposes than anything
else.


#### Does Mina support shielded transactions, like in Zcash?

No, Mina does not natively implement privacy features at the moment. However,
privacy is a key consideration for cryptocurrencies, and is also on the
development roadmap.

#### Can I run the Mina daemon as a service

See here for information about using launchd or systemd with Mina.

## SNARKs and Snark Workers

#### Is generating SNARKs similar to Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining?

No, they are different in several ways:

- SNARK work is deterministic, while PoW mining requires randomly calculating
  hashes to try and solve a puzzle. There is no luck element in SNARK work — if
  a snark worker wants to generate a SNARK of a transaction, they only need to
  generate the proof once. This means SNARK work is much less expensive and
  environmentally wasteful, as the compute is all spent towards a productive
  goal.
- There is no difficulty increase for SNARK work, as there is with PoW mining.
  In fact, as SNARK constructions, and proof generation times improve, the
  difficulty may actually decrease.
- SNARK work is not directly involved in consensus. Snark workers play no role
  in determining the next state of the blockchain. Their role is to simply
  generate SNARKs of transactions observed in the network
- As a snark worker, there is no requirement for uptime. PoW miners need to run
  their rigs non-stop to ensure they don't miss out on a potential block. Snark
  workers can come online and offline as they please — it is more like Uber,
  where there will always be work to be done, and nobody needs to say ahead of
  time when they want to work.
