# Experimental features

New features are considered experimental before they are production-ready.

Exposing experimental features gives you an opportunity to try our newest features sooner.

In return, your feedback helps us make sure that our new features are reliable and useful.

## Feedback

We appreciate any and all feedback you want to provide. 

The best place to provide feedback and ask questions is on [Mina Protocol Discord](https://bit.ly/MinaDiscord]. 

Experimental features are in active development and your feedback is especially appreciated.

- The feature may have bugs
- The feature may be changed, deprecated, or removed
- Any documentation for the feature explicitly notes the feature is experimental
