# Building and running Rosetta from source code

In the [previous article](run-with-docker) we described the Docker cointainer, that runs mina daemon, mina-archive and Rosetta API. 

If you already have mina-archive up and running, you can also build and run Rosetta API natively and wire it to existing mina daemon and archive.

:::note

To run mina daemon and archive natively, follow instructions on the [Archive Node page](node-operators/archive-node)

:::

The easiest way to build Rosetta natively is to use Nix development environment.

1. Clone the official [mina repository](https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina.git) and switch to the `compatible` branch

2. If you don't already have Nix on your machine, install it following steps described in the `nix/README.md` [file in the mina repository](https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/blob/develop/nix/README.md)

3. Run the `./nix/pin.sh` script to enable submodules to be available to the build:


    ./nix/pin.sh


4. Launch the development shell:


    nix develop mina


5. Build Rosetta app:


    dune build --profile=mainnet src/app/rosetta


6. After a succesful build, the Rosetta app is available here: `_build/default/src/app/rosetta/rosetta.exe` 

You can run it with following command:

    MINA_ROSETTA_MAX_DB_POOL_SIZE=64 MINA_ROSETTA_NETWORK=mainnet \
        _build/default/src/app/rosetta/rosetta.exe --port 3087 \
        --graphql-uri <URL to Mina GrasphQL instance> 
        --archive-uri postgres://<username>:<password>@m<host>:<port>/<db_name>
