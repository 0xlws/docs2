# Sending requests

Once the Rosetta app is running, you can send requests to it.
Lets run `/network/list` request:

    curl -L -X POST 'http://localhost:3087/network/list' \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -H 'Accept: application/json' -d '{}'

In case of succesfull setup, you should see a response similar to the one below:


```json
{"network_identifiers":[{"blockchain":"mina","network":"mainnet"}]}
```

You must pass the `network_identifier` object as a parameter to all other endpoints. In Mina Rosetta implementation, it exists only for the network you run Rosetta for, so this array will always contain one object.

Learn how to use Rosetta API for different use-cases in the [Code Samples](samples) section.
