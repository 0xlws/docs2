description: Learn how to track deposits on the given address

Once we have everything ready, let's implement deposit tracking.

For that, we will iterate through all transactions in each block to search for `payment_receiver_inc` operation, with an address matching the address which we are interested in:


```python
def deposit_flow(deposit_address):
    # some logic we want to execute on deposit
    def on_deposit(deposit):
        pprint_json(deposit)
    
    latest_block = network_status()["current_block_identifier"]["index"]
    while True:
        # check if transactions to the deposit address are present in the latest block
        txs = wait_for_block(latest_block)['block']['transactions']
        deposits = []
        for tx in txs:
            for op in tx["operations"]:
                if op["account"]["address"] == deposit_address \
                        and op["type"] == "payment_receiver_inc":
                    deposits.append({
                        "tx_hash": tx["transaction_identifier"]["hash"],
                        "amount": op["amount"]["value"]
                    })
        
        # process deposits
        for d in deposits:
            on_deposit(d)

        latest_block += 1
```
