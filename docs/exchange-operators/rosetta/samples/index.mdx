:::info

The code samples in this section are tested with Python 3.9

:::

The following series of guides demonstrate how to perform common Rosetta API use-cases. 

All code samples are written in Python and require the `requests` library to be installed on your Python environment.

This can be done with a following command:

    pip3 install requests

The source code for all code samples is available on the official [Mina Documentation Github page](https://github.com/o1-labs/docs2) (TODO: insert link) and should be used only for demonstration purposes.
