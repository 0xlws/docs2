Learn how to use Mina’s implementation of Rosetta API.
</Subhead>

[Rosetta API](https://www.rosetta-api.org/) is an open-source specification and set of tools that make deploying and interacting with the blockchain quickly and easily.

Use Rosetta API if you are:
- Querying historical data from the Mina blockchain
- Integrating the Mina blockchain with your exchange
- Building blockchain applications, such as explorers and wallets

### Run with Docker

1. [Install Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and check that your Docker configuration has at least 12 GB RAM (the recommended amount is 16 GB).

2. Check the latest release for mainnet on the official [Mina github releases page](https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/releases). 

3. Go to `minaprotocol/mina-rosetta` [page on the Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/minaprotocol/mina-rosetta). Pull the image with commit hash matching to the latest mainnet release.

4. Use this image

:::note

If you want to build your own docker image, you can find more details in [Mina’s Rosetta repository](https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/blob/develop/src/app/rosetta/README.md). However, for most users, it’s not necessary to build your own image in order to interact with the API.

:::

The container in `/rosetta` includes four entrypoints, which each run a different set of services connected to a particular network.

- **docker-start.sh** (default) - connects the mina node to our Mainnet network and initializes the archive database from publicly-available nightly O(1) Labs backups. This script runs a mina node, mina-archive, a postgresql DB, and mina-rosetta. The script also periodically checks for blocks that may be missing between the nightly backup and the tip of the chain and will fill in those gaps by walking back the linked list of blocks in the canonical chain and importing them one at a time. Take a look at the source for more information about what and how you can configure.
- **docker-standalone-start.sh** - starts only the mina-rosetta API endpoint and any flags passed into the script go to mina-rosetta. Use this for the "offline" part of the Construction API.
- **docker-demo-start.sh** launches a mina node with a very simple 1-address genesis ledger as a sandbox for developing and playing around in. This script starts the full suite of tools (a mina node, mina-archive, a postgresql DB, and mina-rosetta), but for a demo network with all operations occurring inside this container and no external network activity.
- **docker-devnet-start.sh** - connects the mina node to our Devnet network with the archive database initialized in a similar way to `docker-start.sh`. As with `docker-start.sh`, this script runs a mina node, mina-archive, a postgresql DB, and mina-rosetta. `docker-devnet-start.sh` is now just a special case of `docker-start.sh` so inspect the source there for more detailed configuration.

Run the container with following command (replace the image tag with the latest one from dockerhub, also replace `--entrypoint` if needed):

    docker run -it --rm --name rosetta \
        --entrypoint=./docker-start.sh \
        -p 10101:10101 -p 3085:3085 -p 3086:3086 -p 3087:3087 \
        minaprotocol/mina-rosetta:<tag>

:::note

- It can take 20 min to 1 hour for your node to sync
- Port 10101 is the default P2P port and must be exposed to the open internet
- The GraphQL API runs on port 3085 (accessible via localhost:3085/graphql)
- PostgreSQL runs on port 3086
- Rosetta runs on port 3087

### Run natively

The abovementioned cointainer runs mina daemon, mina-archive and Rosetta API. 
You may want to build and run Rosetta API natively and wire it to existing mina daemon and archive.

:::note

If you want to run mina daemon and archive natively, follow instructions on the [Archive Node page](https://docs.minaprotocol.com/node-operators/archive-node)

:::

The easiest way to build natively is to use Nix development environment.

1. Clone the official [mina repository](https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina.git) and switch to the `compatible` branch

2. If you don't already have Nix on your machine, install it following steps described in the `nix/README.md` [file in the mina repository](https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/blob/develop/nix/README.md)

3. Run `./nix/pin.sh` to enable submodules to be available to the build

4. Launch the development shell:

    nix develop mina

5. Build Rosetta app:

    dune build --profile=mainnet src/app/rosetta

6. After a succesful build, the Rosetta app is available by the following path: `_build/default/src/app/rosetta/rosetta.exe` 

You can run it with following command:

    MINA_ROSETTA_MAX_DB_POOL_SIZE=64 MINA_ROSETTA_NETWORK=mainnet \
        _build/default/src/app/rosetta/rosetta.exe --port 3087 \
        --graphql-uri <URL to Mina GrasphQL instance> 
        --archive-uri postgres://<username>:<password>@m<host>:<port>/<db_name>
