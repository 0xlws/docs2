zkApp programmability is not yet available on the Mina Mainnet. You can get started now by deploying zkApps to the Berkeley Testnet.

# zkApps Getting Started

You can start writing zkApps with just a few steps.

## High-Level Workflow

1. [Install or update the zkApp CLI](#1-install-or-update-the-zkapp-cli)
1. [Create a project](#2-create-a-project)
1. [Add smart contract code](#3-add-smart-contract-code)
1. [Add testing code](#4-add-testing-code)
1. [Add functionality](#5-add-functionality)
1. [Create an integration test](#6-create-an-integration-test)
1. [Test with a live network](#7-test-with-a-live-network)

### 1. Install or update the zkApp CLI

```sh
npm install -g zkapp-cli
```

The zkApp CLI provides project scaffolding, including dependencies such as [o1js](/zkapps/o1js), a test framework, code auto-formatting, linting, and more.

See [zkApp CLI Installation](/zkapps/install-zkapp-cli).

### 2. Create a project

```sh
zk project <project-name>
```

A zkApp consists of a smart contract and a UI to interact with it. 

- To proceed without an accompanying UI project, select `none` when prompted.
- To create a UI, select a framework and follow the prompts. 

See [How to Write a zkApp UI](/zkapps/how-to-write-a-zkapp-ui).

### 3. Add smart contract code

Add the smart contract code to your zkApp project using the [o1js](/zkapps/o1js) TypeScript library that was included automatically when you created your project using the zkApp CLI.

Refer to the basic smart contract example that was generated when you created your project:

1. Import `o1js`. 

    See `import` in the [Add.ts](https://github.com/o1-labs/zkapp-cli/blob/main/templates/project-ts/src/Add.ts#L1) file.

1. Extend the `SmartContract` class.

    See the exported `class` in the [Add.ts](https://github.com/o1-labs/zkapp-cli/blob/main/templates/project-ts/src/Add.ts#L12) file. 

See [Smart Contracts](https://docs.minaprotocol.com/zkapps/o1js/smart-contracts).

### 4. Add testing code

When you use the zkApp CLI to create a project, tests and examples are included.

1. Import the smart contract and `o1js` into your test file. 

    See the `import` statements in the [Add.test.ts](https://github.com/o1-labs/zkapp-cli/blob/main/templates/project-ts/src/Add.test.ts#L1-L2) example file.

1. Create a `LocalBlockchain` instance to interact with.

    See the local blockchain code in the [Add.test.ts](https://github.com/o1-labs/zkapp-cli/blob/main/templates/project-ts/src/Add.test.ts#L27-L28) example file.

1. Initialize some test accounts that will pay fees and sign transactions. o1js provides an array of 10 such accounts you can start using right away.

    See the initialize account code in the [Add.test.ts](https://github.com/o1-labs/zkapp-cli/blob/main/templates/project-ts/src/Add.test.ts#L29-L31) example file.

1. Deploy the smart contract to the local blockchain.

    See the `localDeploy` function in the [Add.test.ts](https://github.com/o1-labs/zkapp-cli/blob/main/templates/project-ts/src/Add.test.ts#L38-L46) example file.

### 5. Add functionality

Add the logic for your smart contract.

1. Add functionality to the smart contract by implementing a `@method`.

    See the `update` method in the [Add.ts](https://github.com/o1-labs/zkapp-cli/blob/main/templates/project-ts/src/Add.ts#L20) example file.

    <!-- do we point user somewhere for method? or? -->

1. Build the smart contract:

    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```

1. Invoke the method you added or use new functionality in the test file.

    See the update transaction code in the [Add.test.ts](https://github.com/o1-labs/zkapp-cli/blob/main/templates/project-ts/src/Add.test.ts#L57-L65) file.

    - If it works as expected with no errors, add more functionality.
    - If there are errors, look through the stack traces to find the source of the errors and update the contract to resolve them.

### 6. Create an integration test.

- Instead of using Jest, create a Node.js script to run the smart contract and test it's functionality, similar to step [4. Add testing code](#4-add-testing-code).

    See the example Node.js script that runs the Add smart contract [run.ts](https://github.com/o1-labs/zkapp-cli/blob/main/examples/tictactoe/ts/src/run.ts) file. 

<!-- which run.ts file are we referring to? I only found run.ts for the sudoku and tictacktoe tests -->

### 7. Test with a live network

To deploy the smart contract to the Testnet, run the `zk` commands from the directory that contains your smart contract. 

1. Configure your zkapp.

    ```sh
    zk config
    ```

    Follow the prompts to specify a deploy alias name (can be anything), URL to deploy to, fee (in MINA) to be used when sending your deploy transaction, and the fee payer account. 

    For the Berkeley Testnet, use: <!-- or whatever the ITN is called, let's give that specific information -->
 
    - Deploy alias name: `berkeley` 
  
    - Mina GraphQL API URL: `https://proxy.berkeley.minaexplorer.com/graphql`
  
    - Transaction fee to use when deploying: `0.1`
  
    - Account to pay transaction fees: Create a new fee payer pair
    
    See [Add a deploy alias to config.json](/zkapps/how-to-deploy-a-zkapp#add-a-deploy-alias-to-configjson).

1. Choose a fee payer alias. A fee payer account is a developer account that is funded and can always pay fees immediately. When you configure a zkApp, you can choose to use a stored account or create a new fee payer account.

    - When prompted to choose an account to pay transaction fees, select to use a different account:

        ```sh
        Use a different account (select to see options)
        ```

        If this is the first time you are running the `zk config` command, you see these options:

        ```text
        ‚ùØ Recover fee payer account from an existing base58 private key
        Create a new fee payer key pair
        ```

        The option to choose another account is shown only if you have a cached fee payer account.

    - Next, select to create a new fee payer key pair:  

        ```sh
        Create a new fee payer key pair
        NOTE: the private key will be stored in plain text on this computer.
        ```

    - When prompted, give an alias to your new fee payer key pair. 

1. Fund your fee payer account.

    Follow the prompts to request tMina. 

1. Deploy to the Testnet. <!-- don't we need to deploy? do we want to name the Testnet here? -->

    ```sh
    zk deploy
    ```

    Follow the prompts. 
    
    See [How to deploy a zkApp](/zkapps/how-to-deploy-a-zkapp).

1. Create a script to interact with a live network.

    See the example files:
    - https://github.com/o1-labs/zkapp-cli/blob/main/templates/project-ts/src/interact.ts
    - https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/blob/main/src/examples/zkapps/hello_world/run_live.ts

1. Run your script.

    For example:

    ```sh
    node build/src/interact.js
    ```

1. Keep building and experimenting! After you add features to your contract, repeat [7. Test with a live network](#7-test-with-a-live-network) to test with a live network.
