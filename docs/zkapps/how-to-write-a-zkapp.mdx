zkApps can now be deployed to Berkeley Testnet.

# How to Write a zkApp

A zkApp consists of a smart contract and a UI to interact with it. 

Write your smart contract using the [Mina zkApp CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zkapp-cli/). 

First, install the Mina zkApp CLI.

The Mina zkApp CLI makes it easy to follow recommended best practices by providing project scaffolding including dependencies such as SnarkyJS, a test framework [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), code auto-formatting [Prettier](https://prettier.io/
), linting [ES Lint](https://eslint.org/), and more.

## Install Mina zkApp CLI

```sh
npm install -g zkapp-cli
```

Dependencies:

- NodeJS 16+ (or 14 using `node --experimental-wasm-threads`)
- NPM 6+
- Git 2+

If you have a later version installed, install the required version using the package manager for your system: 

- MacOs [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

- Windows [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)

- Linux (apt, yum, and others)

    As recommended by the Node.js project, you might need to install a recent Node.js version using NodeSource binary distributions: [Debian](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#debinstall), [rpm](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#rpminstall).

## Start a project

Now that you have the Mina zkApp CLI installed, you can start with an example or start your own project.

Example projects do not create an accompanying UI. 

### Option A: Start with an example (recommended)

Examples are based on the standard project structure and provide additional files in the `/src` directory.

1. Create the example project: `zk example`

  The `zk example` command prompts you to select an example project:

  ```text
  ? Choose an example …
❯ sudoku
  tictactoe
  ```

  Select the `sudoku` example project. 

  The created project includes the example files (the smart contract) in the project's `src/` directory. 
  
  To see the files that were created, change to the `sudoku` directory and run the `ls` command or open the directory in a code editor, such as VS Code.

1. Run tests and see the tests pass: `npm run test`  
  
  To rerun tests automatically when you save changes to your code, run the tests in watch mode with `npm run testw`.

1. Build the example: `npm run build`

  Compile your TypeScript into JavaScript in the project `/build` directory.

1. Configure your zkApp: `zk config`

  The command prompts guide you to add a deploy alias to your project `config.json` file. The deploy alias can be anything you want. For this example, use `berkeley`.
  
  For Berkeley Testnet, use:
  
    - name: `berkeley`
    - Mina GraphQL API URL: `https://proxy.berkeley.minaexplorer.com/graphql`
    - transaction fee: `0.1`

1. Fund your fee payer account.

  Follow the prompts to request tMINA. 

1. Deploy to Testnet: `zk deploy`

  Follow the prompts. For details, see [how to deploy a zkApp](how-to-deploy-a-zkapp).

### Option B: Start your own project

1. Create your own project: `zk project <myproj>`

    The created project includes the files (the smart contract) in the project's `src/` directory. 

1. Select an accompanying UI framework, if any:

    ```text
    ? Create an accompanying UI project too? …
  ❯ next
    svelte
    nuxt
    empty
    none
    ```
    
    For your selected UI framework, follow the prompts.

    To see the files that were created, change to the project (whatever you called `<myproj>`) directory and run the `ls` command or open the directory in a code editor, such as VS Code.

1. Run tests and see the tests pass: `npm run test`  
  
    To rerun tests automatically when you save changes to your code, run the tests in watch mode with `npm run testw`.

1. Build the example: `npm run build`

    Compile your TypeScript into JavaScript in the project `/build` directory.

1. Configure your zkApp: `zk config`

    The command prompts guide you to add a deploy alias to your project `config.json` file. The deploy alias can be anything you want. For this example, use `berkeley`.

    For Berkeley Testnet, use:

    - name: `berkeley`
    - Mina GraphQL API URL: `https://proxy.berkeley.minaexplorer.com/graphql`
    - transaction fee: `0.1`

1. Fund your fee payer account.

    Follow the prompts to request tMina. 

1. Deploy to Testnet: `zk deploy`

    Follow the prompts. For details, see [how to deploy a zkApp](how-to-deploy-a-zkapp).

### Writing your smart contract

zkApps are written in TypeScript using SnarkyJS. SnarkyJS is a TypeScript library for writing smart contracts based on zero-knowledge proofs for the Mina Protocol. It is included automatically when creating a new project using the Mina zkApp CLI.

To get started writing zkApps, begin with these SnarkyJS docs:

- [Basic concepts](./snarkyjs/basic-concepts)
- [Smart contracts](./snarkyjs/smart-contracts)
- [Interacting with Mina](./snarkyjs/interact-with-mina)

For guided steps to create your first zkApp, start with [Tutorial 1: Hello World](./tutorials/hello-world).

For comprehensive details about the SnarkyJS API, see the [SnarkyJS reference](snarkyjs-reference).
