Please note that zkApp programmability is not yet available on Mina Mainnet, but
zkApps can now be deployed to Berkeley Testnet.

# How to Write a zkApp

A zkApp consists of a smart contract and a UI to interact with it. First, install the Mina zkApp CLI and write a smart contract.

## Write a smart contract

Write your smart contract using the [Mina zkApp CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zkapp-cli/).

Mina zkApp CLI makes it easy to follow recommended best practices by providing project scaffolding including dependencies such as SnarkyJS, a test framework (<a href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a>), code auto-formatting (<a href="https://prettier.io/
">Prettier</a>), linting (<a href="https://eslint.org/">ES Lint</a>), & more.

### Install Mina zkApp CLI

```sh
npm install -g zkapp-cli
```

#### Dependencies:

- NodeJS 16+ (or 14 using `node --experimental-wasm-threads`)
- NPM 6+
- Git 2+

:::tip

If you have an older version installed, install a newer version using the package manager for your system: <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> (Mac), <a href="https://chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey</a> (Windows), or apt/yum/etc (Linux). On Linux, you may need to install a recent NodeJS version via NodeSource (<a href="https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#debinstall">deb</a> or <a href="https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#rpminstall">rpm</a>), as recommended by the NodeJS Project.

### Start a project

Now that you have Mina zkApp CLI installed, you can start with an example or start your own project.

#### Option A: Start with an example (recommended)

Examples are based on the standard project structure, but with additional files in the `/src` directory as the only difference.

1. **Install:** Run `zk example sudoku`. This creates a new project and includes
   the example files (i.e. the smart contract) inside the project’s `src/`
   directory. Type `ls` & hit enter to see the files that were created or open
   the directory in a code editor such as VS Code.
2. **Run tests:** Run `npm run test`. Tests are written using <a
   href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a>. After running this command, you
   see all tests pass. You can also run `npm run testw` to run tests in watch
   mode, so tests are automatically re-run tests when you save changes to your code.
3. **Build the example:** Run `npm run build` to compile your TypeScript
   into JavaScript inside the project’s `/build` directory.
4. **Deploy to Testnet:** Run `zk config`. The command walks you through adding a
   network alias to your project’s `config.json`. For Berkeley Testnet, use `berkeley` as the name, `0.1` for the fee, and
   `https://proxy.berkeley.minaexplorer.com/graphql` for the url. Then run `zk deploy` and follow the prompts. See the [how to deploy a zkApp](how-to-deploy-a-zkapp) page for further details.

You can view a list of <a href="https://github.com/o1-labs/zkapp-cli/tree/main/examples/">all available examples here</a>.

#### Option B: Start your own project

1. **Install:** Run `zk project <myproj>`. Type `ls` and hit enter to see the
   newly created project structure. _Note_: If you want to directly scaffold an UI with your new zkApp, you can do so by adding the `--ui` flag to the previous command, like `zk project <myproj> --ui=<framework>`. You can currently choose from the following frameworks: `svelte`, `next` or `nuxt`
2. **Run tests:** Run `npm run test`. Tests are written using <a
   href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a>. After running this command, you can
   see that all tests pass. You can also run `npm run testw` to run tests in watch
   mode, so tests are automatically re-run you save changes to your code.
3. **Build:** Run `npm run build` to compile your TypeScript code into
   JavaScript inside the project’s `/build`.
4. **Deploy to Testnet:** Run `zk config`. The command walks you through adding a
   network alias to your project’s `config.json`. For Berkeley Testnet, use `berkeley` as the name, `0.1` for the fee, and
   `https://proxy.berkeley.minaexplorer.com/graphql` for the url. Then run `zk deploy` and follow the prompts. See the [how to deploy a zkApp](how-to-deploy-a-zkapp) page for further details.
5. **Deploy to Mainnet:** (Coming soon.)

### Writing your smart contract

zkApps are written in TypeScript using SnarkyJS. SnarkyJS is a TypeScript library for writing smart contracts based on zero-knowledge proofs for the Mina Protocol. It is included automatically when creating a new project using the Mina zkApp CLI.

See [the SnarkyJS docs](snarkyjs) to learn more. The first 3 subsections are enough to get you started writing zkApps:

- [Basic concepts](./snarkyjs/basic-concepts)
- [Smart contracts](./snarkyjs/smart-contracts)
- [Interacting with Mina](./snarkyjs/interact-with-mina)

Alternatively, we recommend [Tutorial 1: Hello World](./tutorials/hello-world) as a hands-on walkthrough that teaches you to create your first zkApp.

For a comprehensive documentation of the SnarkyJS API, please see the [SnarkyJS reference](snarkyjs-reference).

## Next Steps

Now that you've learned how to write and operate a basic smart contract, you can learn [how to test your zkApp](how-to-test-a-zkapp).
