# Bitwise Gadgets in o1js

Bitwise operations work on 2-bit patterns of equal lengths by positionally matching their individual bits. 

- [and](#and)
- [compactMultiRangeCheck](#compactmultirangecheck)
- [leftShift](#leftshift)
- [multiRangeCheck](#multirangecheck)
- [not](#not)
- [rangeCheck64](#rangecheck64)
- [rightShift](#rightshift)
- [rotate](#rotate)
- [xor](#xor)

## and

```ts
and(a: Field, b: Field, length: number) {
    return and(a, b, length);
```

The bitwise `and()` gadget on Field elements is equivalent to the [bitwise AND (&)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_AND) operator in JavaScript. 

- The `and()` gadget works by comparing two bits and returns `1` only if both bits are `1`, otherwise it returns `0`.
- `and()` can be checked by a double generic gate that verifies the following relationship between the values. In the process, the `and()` gadget also invokes the [xor()](#xor) gadget that creates additional constraints depending on `length`.

  The generic gate verifies `a + b = sum` and the conjunction equation `2 * and = sum - xor`.

  where:
  * `a + b = sum`
  * `a ^ b = xor`
  * `a & b = and`

For details about the implementation, see [AND](https://o1-labs.github.io/proof-systems/specs/kimchi.html?highlight=gates#and) in the Mina book.

The `length` parameter:

- Defines how many bits to compare. 
- Rounds `length` to the nearest multiple of 16, `paddedLength = ceil(length / 16) * 16`.
- Constrains both input values to fit into `paddedLength` bits. 
- Guarantees that the output is has at most `paddedLength` bits.
- **Note:** Specifying a larger `length` parameter adds additional constraints.

Both Field elements must fit into `2^paddedLength - 1` or an error is thrown and no proof is generated.

With `length = 2` (`paddedLength = 16`), `and()` fails for any input that is larger than `2**16`.

Example:

```ts
let a = Field(3);    // ... 000011
let b = Field(5);    // ... 000101
let c = Gadgets.and(a, b, 2);    // ... 000001
c.assertEquals(1);
```

## compactMultiRangeCheck

```ts
(xy: Field, z: Field) => [Field, Field, Field]
```

The bitwise `compactMultiRangeCheck()` gadget on Field elements is a variant of [multiRangeCheck](#multirangecheck) where the first two variables are passed in combined form `xy = x + 2^88*y`. 

The `compactMultiRangeCheck()` gadget:

- Splits `xy` into `x` and `y`.
- Proves that `xy = x + 2^88*y`.
- Proves that `x, y, z` are all in the range `[0, 2^88)`.
- Returns the split form `[x, y, z]`.
- Throws an error if `xy` exceeds `2*88 = 176` bits or if `z` exceeds 88 bits.

Example: 

```ts
let [x, y] = Gadgets.compactMultiRangeCheck([xy, z]);
```

 /**
   * Compact multi-range check
   *
   * This is a variant of {@link multiRangeCheck} where the first two variables are passed in
   * combined form xy = x + 2^88*y.
   *
   * The gadget
   * - splits up xy into x and y
   * - proves that xy = x + 2^88*y
   * - proves that x, y, z are all in the range [0, 2^88).
   *
   * The split form [x, y, z] is returned.
   *
   * @example
   * ```ts
   * let [x, y] = Gadgets.compactMultiRangeCheck([xy, z]);
   * ```
   *
   * @throws Throws an error if `xy` exceeds 2*88 = 176 bits, or if z exceeds 88 bits.
   */
  compactMultiRangeCheck(xy: Field, z: Field) {
    return compactMultiRangeCheck(xy, z);
  },

## leftShift

Provable method that supports the bitwise shifting operation that moves the bits of a binary number to the right. Unlike rotation, the bits that fall off at the end are discarded and the vacant positions are filled with zeros.


  /**
   * Performs a left shift operation on the provided {@link Field} element.
   * This operation is similar to the `<<` shift operation in JavaScript,
   * where bits are shifted to the left, and the overflowing bits are discarded.
   *
   * Itâ€™s important to note that these operations are performed considering the big-endian 64-bit representation of the number,
   * where the most significant (64th) bit is on the left end and the least significant bit is on the right end.
   *
   * **Important:** The gadgets assumes that its input is at most 64 bits in size.
   *
   * If the input exceeds 64 bits, the gadget is invalid and fails to prove correct execution of the shift.
   * Therefore, to safely use `leftShift()`, you need to make sure that the values passed in are range checked to 64 bits.
   * For example, this can be done with {@link Gadgets.rangeCheck64}.
   *
   * @param field {@link Field} element to shift.
   * @param bits Amount of bits to shift the {@link Field} element to the left. The amount should be between 0 and 64 (or else the shift will fail).
   *
   * @throws Throws an error if the input value exceeds 64 bits.
   *
   * @example
   * ```ts
   * const x = Provable.witness(Field, () => Field(0b001100)); // 12 in binary
   * const y = Gadgets.leftShift(x, 2); // left shift by 2 bits
   * y.assertEquals(0b110000); // 48 in binary
   *
   * const xLarge = Provable.witness(Field, () => Field(12345678901234567890123456789012345678n));
   * leftShift(xLarge, 32); // throws an error since input exceeds 64 bits
   * ```
   */
  leftShift(field: Field, bits: number) {
    return leftShift(field, bits);
  },

## multiRangeCheck

Building block for non-native arithmetic with BigInt of size up to 264 bits. https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1216

A building block for non-native arithmetic with BigInt of size up to 264 bits. A provable method for efficient 64-bit range checks using lookup tables. https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1181


 /**
   * Multi-range check.
   *
   * Proves that x, y, z are all in the range [0, 2^88).
   *
   * This takes 4 rows, so it checks 88*3/4 = 66 bits per row. This is slightly more efficient
   * than 64-bit range checks, which can do 64 bits in 1 row.
   *
   * In particular, the 3x88-bit range check supports bigints up to 264 bits, which in turn is enough
   * to support foreign field multiplication with moduli up to 2^259.
   *
   * @example
   * ```ts
   * Gadgets.multiRangeCheck([x, y, z]);
   * ```
   *
   * @throws Throws an error if one of the input values exceeds 88 bits.
   */
  multiRangeCheck(limbs: Field3) {
    multiRangeCheck(limbs);
  },


## not

```ts
not(a: Field, length: number, checked: boolean = false) {
    return not(a, length, checked);
  },
```

A provable method to support bitwise shifting for native Field elements. https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1198

The bitwise not gadget on Field elements is similar to the [Bitwise NOT (~)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_NOT) operator in JavaScript to support bitwise shifting for native Field elements.

A bitwise NOT operation returns:

- `1` in each bit position if the corresponding bit of the operand is `0`
- `0` if the corresponding bit of the operand is `1`

The NOT gate operates only over the number of bits specified by the `length` parameter.

The `length` parameter:

- Lets you define how many bits to NOT.
- **Note:** Specifying a larger `length` parameter adds additional constraints.

The operation fails if the length or the input value is larger than 254 bits.

The not gadget is implemented in two different ways:

- If the `checked` parameter is set to `false`, NOT is implemented as a subtraction of the input from the all one bitmask. If the `checked` parameter is not provided, the default implementation uses `false`.
- If the `checked` parameter is set to `true`, the [xor()](#xor) gadget is reused with a second argument to be an all one bitmask the same length. This approach needs as many rows as an XOR requires for a single negation. 

For implementation details, see [NOT](https://o1-labs.github.io/proof-systems/specs/kimchi.html?highlight=gates#not) in the Mina book.

Example not-ing 4 bits with the unchecked version:

```ts
let a = Field(0b0101);
let b = Gadgets.not(a,4,false);

b.assertEquals(0b1010);
```

Example not-ing 4 bits with the checked version using the `xor()` gadget:

```ts
let a = Field(0b0101);
let b = Gadgets.not(a,4,true);

b.assertEquals(0b1010);
```

where:
- Parameter `a` is the Field value to apply NOT to. The operation fails if the value is larger than 254.
- Parameter `length` is the number of bits (4 in this example) to be considered for the NOT operation.
- Parameter `checked` is an optional boolean (true or false) to determine if the checked or unchecked not implementation is used.
  
## rangecheck64

  /**
   * Asserts that the input value is in the range [0, 2^64).
   *
   * This function proves that the provided field element can be represented with 64 bits.
   * If the field element exceeds 64 bits, an error is thrown.
   *
   * @param x - The value to be range-checked.
   *
   * @throws Throws an error if the input value exceeds 64 bits.
   *
   * @example
   * ```ts
   * const x = Provable.witness(Field, () => Field(12345678n));
   * Gadgets.rangeCheck64(x); // successfully proves 64-bit range
   *
   * const xLarge = Provable.witness(Field, () => Field(12345678901234567890123456789012345678n));
   * Gadgets.rangeCheck64(xLarge); // throws an error since input exceeds 64 bits
   * ```
   *
   * **Note**: Small "negative" field element inputs are interpreted as large integers close to the field size,
   * and don't pass the 64-bit check. If you want to prove that a value lies in the int64 range [-2^63, 2^63),
   * you could use `rangeCheck64(x.add(1n << 63n))`.
   */
  rangeCheck64(x: Field) {
    return rangeCheck64(x);
  },




## rightShift

```ts(field: Field, bits: number) => Field
```

Provable method that supports the bitwise shifting operation that moves the bits of a binary number to the right. Unlike rotation, the bits that fall off at the end are discarded and the vacant positions are filled with zeros.

handles the constant case by using the added functionality in the bindings. For the prover case,

 /**
   * Performs a right shift operation on the provided {@link Field} element.
   * This is similar to the `>>` shift operation in JavaScript, where bits are moved to the right.
   * The `rightShift` function utilizes the rotation method internally to implement this operation.
   *
   * * Itâ€™s important to note that these operations are performed considering the big-endian 64-bit representation of the number,
   * where the most significant (64th) bit is on the left end and the least significant bit is on the right end.
   *
   * **Important:** The gadgets assumes that its input is at most 64 bits in size.
   *
   * If the input exceeds 64 bits, the gadget is invalid and fails to prove correct execution of the shift.
   * To safely use `rightShift()`, you need to make sure that the value passed in is range-checked to 64 bits;
   * for example, using {@link Gadgets.rangeCheck64}.
   *
   * @param field {@link Field} element to shift.
   * @param bits Amount of bits to shift the {@link Field} element to the right. The amount should be between 0 and 64 (or else the shift will fail).
   *
   * @throws Throws an error if the input value exceeds 64 bits.
   *
   * @example
   * ```ts
   * const x = Provable.witness(Field, () => Field(0b001100)); // 12 in binary
   * const y = Gadgets.rightShift(x, 2); // right shift by 2 bits
   * y.assertEquals(0b000011); // 3 in binary
   *
   * const xLarge = Provable.witness(Field, () => Field(12345678901234567890123456789012345678n));
   * rightShift(xLarge, 32); // throws an error since input exceeds 64 bits
   * ```

    return rightShift(field, bits);

## rotate

```ts
(field: Field, bits: number, direction: "left" | "right") => Field
```

A provable method to support bitwise rotation for native Field elements. https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1182 

A rotation, often referred to as a bitwise rotation, is an operation that shifts the bits of a binary number either to the left or to the right. In contrast to a standard shift operation, the bits that fall off the end are not discarded. Instead, they wrap around to the other end.

Rotate Left (ROL): In this operation, bits are shifted to the left. The bits that fall off the leftmost side wrap around and reappear on the rightmost side.
Rotate Right (ROR): In this operation, bits are shifted to the right. The bits that fall off the rightmost side wrap around and reappear on the leftmost side.

The ROT implementation handles the constant case by using the added functionality in the bindings. For the prover case, how to implement?

 /**
   * A (left and right) rotation operates similarly to the shift operation (`<<` for left and `>>` for right) in JavaScript,
   * with the distinction that the bits are circulated to the opposite end of a 64-bit representation rather than being discarded.
   * For a left rotation, this means that bits shifted off the left end reappear at the right end.
   * Conversely, for a right rotation, bits shifted off the right end reappear at the left end.
   *
   * Itâ€™s important to note that these operations are performed considering the big-endian 64-bit representation of the number,
   * where the most significant (64th) bit is on the left end and the least significant bit is on the right end.
   * The `direction` parameter is a string that accepts either `'left'` or `'right'`, determining the direction of the rotation.
   *
   * **Important:** The gadget assumes that its input is at most 64 bits in size.
   *
   * If the input exceeds 64 bits, the gadget is invalid and fails to prove correct execution of the rotation.
   * To safely use `rotate()`, you need to make sure that the value passed in is range-checked to 64 bits;
   * for example, using {@link Gadgets.rangeCheck64}.
   *
   * You can find more details about the implementation in the [Mina book](https://o1-labs.github.io/proof-systems/specs/kimchi.html?highlight=gates#rotation)
   *
   * @param field {@link Field} element to rotate.
   * @param bits amount of bits to rotate this {@link Field} element with.
   * @param direction left or right rotation direction.
   *
   * @throws Throws an error if the input value exceeds 64 bits.
   *
   * @example
   * ```ts
   * const x = Provable.witness(Field, () => Field(0b001100));
   * const y = Gadgets.rotate(x, 2, 'left'); // left rotation by 2 bits
   * const z = Gadgets.rotate(x, 2, 'right'); // right rotation by 2 bits
   * y.assertEquals(0b110000);
   * z.assertEquals(0b000011);
   *
   * const xLarge = Provable.witness(Field, () => Field(12345678901234567890123456789012345678n));
   * Gadgets.rotate(xLarge, 32, "left"); // throws an error since input exceeds 64 bits
   * ```
   */
  rotate(field: Field, bits: number, direction: 'left' | 'right' = 'left') {
    return rotate(field, bits, direction);
  },

## xor

```ts
(a: Field, b: Field, length: number) => Field
```

A provable method to support bitwise XOR operations for native Field elements. https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1177 

  /**
   * Bitwise XOR gadget on {@link Field} elements. Equivalent to the [bitwise XOR `^` operator in JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_XOR).
   * A XOR gate works by comparing two bits and returning `1` if two bits differ, and `0` if two bits are equal.
   *
   * This gadget builds a chain of XOR gates recursively. Each XOR gate can verify 16 bit at most. If your input elements exceed 16 bit, another XOR gate will be added to the chain.
   *
   * The `length` parameter lets you define how many bits should be compared. `length` is rounded to the nearest multiple of 16, `paddedLength = ceil(length / 16) * 16`, and both input values are constrained to fit into `paddedLength` bits. The output is guaranteed to have at most `paddedLength` bits as well.
   *
   * **Note:** Specifying a larger `length` parameter adds additional constraints.
   *
   * It is also important to mention that specifying a smaller `length` allows the verifier to infer the length of the original input data (e.g. smaller than 16 bit if only one XOR gate has been used).
   * A zkApp developer should consider these implications when choosing the `length` parameter and carefully weigh the trade-off between increased amount of constraints and security.
   *
   * **Important:** Both {@link Field} elements need to fit into `2^paddedLength - 1`. Otherwise, an error is thrown and no proof can be generated.
   *
   * For example, with `length = 2` (`paddedLength = 16`), `xor()` will fail for any input that is larger than `2**16`.
   *
   * You can find more details about the implementation in the [Mina book](https://o1-labs.github.io/proof-systems/specs/kimchi.html?highlight=gates#xor-1)
   *
   * @param a {@link Field} element to compare.
   * @param b {@link Field} element to compare.
   * @param length amount of bits to compare.
   *
   * @throws Throws an error if the input values exceed `2^paddedLength - 1`.
   *
   * @example
   * ```ts
   * let a = Field(0b0101);
   * let b = Field(0b0011);
   *
   * let c = Gadgets.xor(a, b, 4); // xor-ing 4 bits
   * c.assertEquals(0b0110);
   * ```
   */
  xor(a: Field, b: Field, length: number) {
    return xor(a, b, length);
  },
