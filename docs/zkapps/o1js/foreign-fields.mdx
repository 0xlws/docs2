# Foreign Field Arthmetic

A foreign field is a finite field different from the native Field of the proof system. The [ForeignField](https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/blob/main/src/lib/gadgets/foreign-field.ts) namespace exposes operations like modular addition and multiplication that work for any finite field of size less than 2^259. 

Foreign field elements are represented as three limbs of native Field elements.

- Each limb holds 88 bits of the total in little-endian order.
- All `ForeignField` gadgets expect that their input limbs are constrained to the range [0, 2^88).
- The gadget itself adds range checks on outputs.

In o1js, foreign field arithmetic operations are implemented as gadgets.
