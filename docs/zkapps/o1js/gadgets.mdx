# Gadgets

Gadgets are small, reusable low-level building blocks that accelerate special computations. Most gadgets build upon custom gates and act as low-level accelerators in the proof system.

Gadgets are amalgamations of the lowest level gates in the proof system (addition, multiplication) into more sophisticated operations. Gadgets in o1js simplify the process of creating new cryptographic primitives and make it possible to efficiently implement other more complex cryptographic algorithms, such as SHA.

See the type declaration for [Gadgets](/zkapps/o1js-reference/modules#gadgets) in the o1js Reference documentation. 

See [Bitwise Gadgets](/zkapps/o1js/bitwise-gadgets).
