# Tutorial 3: Deploy to a Live Network

In previous tutorials, you learned how to deploy and run transactions on a local network. In this tutorial, you deploy a project to a live network.

In this tutorial, you deploy a contract to the Berkeley Testnet.

Mina zkApps are available only on feature-complete Berkeley, Mina's public Testnet. Only minor changes and bug fixes are expected before Mainnet. 

This tutorial reuses the `Square` contract that you created in [Tutorial 1: Hello World](hello-world).

## Prerequisites

This tutorial has been tested with [Mina zkApp CLI](https://github.com/o1-labs/zkapp-cli) version `0.9.0` and [SnarkyJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/snarkyjs) `0.11.0`.

Ensure your environment meets the [Prerequisites](/zkapps/tutorials#prerequisites) for zkApp Developer Tutorials.

## Create a project

1. Create or change to a directory where you have write privileges.

2. Create a project by using the `zk project` command:

  ```sh
  $ zk project 03-deploying-to-a-live-network
  ```

  The `zk project` command has the ability to scaffold the UI for your project. For this tutorial, select `none`:

  ```
  ? Create an accompanying UI project too? …
    next
    svelte
    nuxt
    empty
  ❯ none
  ```
  The expected output is:

  ```sh
  ✔ Create an accompanying UI project too? · none
  ✔ UI: Set up project
  ✔ Initialize Git repo
  ✔ Set up project
  ✔ NPM install
  ✔ NPM build contract
  ✔ Set project name
  ✔ Git init commit

  Success!

  Next steps:
    cd 03-deploying-to-a-live-network
    git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
    git push -u origin main
  ```

  The `zk project` command creates the `03-deploying-to-a-live-network` directory that contains the scaffolding for your project, including tools such as the Prettier code formatting tool, the ESLint static code analysis tool, and the Jest JavaScript testing framework. 

1. Change into the `03-deploying-to-a-live-network` directory.

For this tutorial, you run commands from the root of the `03-deploying-to-a-live-network` directory as you work in the `src` directory on files that contain the TypeScript code for the smart contract. 

Each time you make updates, then build or deploy, the TypeScript code is compiled into JavaScript in the `build` directory.

### Prepare the project

Start by deleting the default files that come with the new project.

1. Delete the default generated files:

  ```sh
  $ rm src/Add.ts
  $ rm src/Add.test.ts
  $ rm src/interact.ts
  ```

1. Now, create a new file for your smart contract:

  ```sh
  $ zk file src/Square
  ```

1. Copy the `src/Square.ts` and `src/index.ts` files from the example files for first tutorial [01-hello-world/src](https://github.com/o1-labs/docs2/tree/main/examples/zkapps/01-hello-world/src) to your local `03-deploying-to-a-live-network/src` directory.

Now that your smart contract is in place, you are ready to deploy your smart contract to Berkeley Testnet.

## Mina zkApp CLI

You already installed the Mina zkApp CLI as part of the [Prerequisites](/zkapps/tutorials#prerequisites), so you have the tools to manage deployments.

In some cases, you might need to create a custom account for your zkApp, for example, to deploy a zkApp to a different key than the fee payer key, programmatically parameterize a zkApp before you initialize it, or create a smart contract programmatically for users as part of an application. For details, see [Interacting with zkApps server-side](/zkapps/tutorials/interacting-with-zkapps-server-side).

## Deploy the smart contract 

The `config.json` configuration file was automatically scaffolded when created your project with the `zk project` command. However, the generated file does not yet contain the deploy alias. 

You can have one or more deploy aliases for your project. Using naming patterns is helpful when you have more than one deploy alias. You can change the name at anytime in the `config.json` file.

A deploy alias consists of:

- A self-describing name. This tutorial uses `berkeley`. The deploy alias name can be anything and does not have to match the network name.
- The Mina GraphQL API URL that defines the network that receives your deploy transaction and broadcast it to the appropriate Mina network (Testnet, Devnet, Mainnet, and so on)
- The transaction fee (in MINA) to use when deploying

The `zk config` command helps manage your deployment. The command prompts guide you to create or update a deploy alias in your project `config.json` file. 

1. To configure your deployment, run the `zk config` command and respond to the prompts:

  ```sh
  $ zk config
  ```

  For this tutorial on Berkeley Testnet, use:
  
    - name: `berkeley`
    - Mina GraphQL API URL: `https://proxy.berkeley.minaexplorer.com/graphql`
    - transaction fee: `0.1`

  Public and private keys to use in your application are automatically generated in `keys/berkeley.json`.

1. Request funds from the Testnet Faucet to fund your fee payer account.

  Follow the prompts to request tMINA. For this tutorial, your MINA ADDRESS is populated on the Testnet Faucet. tMina arrives at your address when the next block is produced (~3 min).

1. To deploy your project:

  ```sh
  $ zk deploy berkeley
  ```

  A verification key for your smart contract is generated (takes 10-30 seconds). 
  
  The deploy process is output:

  ```text
  ✔ Build project
  ✔ Generate build.json
  ✔ Choose smart contract
    Only one smart contract exists in the project: Add
    Your config.json was updated to always use this
    smart contract when deploying to this network.
  ✔ Generate verification key (takes 10-30 sec)
  ✔ Build transaction
  ```

1. Review and confirm the details of the transaction: 
  
  ```text
  ? Confirm to send transaction

  ┌────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ Deploy Alias   │ berkeley                                        │
  ├────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ Url            │ https://proxy.berkeley.minaexplorer.com/graphql │
  ├────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ Smart Contract │ Square                                          │
  └────────────────┴─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
  ```
  
  When prompted, type `yes` to confirm and send the transaction.

  ```text
  ✔ Send to network

  Success! Deploy transaction sent.

  Next step:
    Your smart contract will be live (or updated)
    as soon as the transaction is included in a block:
  ```

1. To see the zkApp transaction, go to `https://berkeley.minaexplorer.com/transaction/<txn-hash>`, where `<txn-hash>` is the transaction hash that is output to your terminal. 

    - The zkApp Pending Transaction shows until the transaction is included in the next block.
    - The zkApp Transaction shows after the transaction is included in a block.

## Success

After the transaction is included in a block, your smart contract is deployed!

The Mina account at this public key now contains the verification key associated with this smart contract.

Because this tutorial used the smart contract for Tutorial 1: Hello World, the smart contract `editState` permissions require that a transaction must contain a valid zk proof that was created by the private key associated with this zkApp account. 

- When a user interacts with this smart contract by providing a proof, the proof is generated locally on the user's device and included in a transaction. 
- When the transaction is submitted to the network, the proof is checked to ensure it is correct and matches the on-chain verification key. 
- After the transaction is accepted, the proof and transaction are recursively proved and bundled into Mina's recursive zero knowledge proof.

When you change the smart contract code, the associated verification key also changes. Use the same steps to redeploy the smart contract. 

For a typical smart contract, permissions are set to allow only proof authorization: the proof in zero knowledge proof. You learn more about setting permissions in a later tutorial.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed a smart contract to a live network.
